# VISUALIZATION-OF-VARIOUS-GRAPH-ALGORITHMS
• Developed a web-based tool using CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for visualizing three popular graph algorithms - Dijkstra Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm, and Kruskal’s Algorithm.
• Implemented each algorithm, highlighting their significance in solving source-to-destination problems and minimum spanning tree problems.
• These algorithms are used in various domains such as Google Maps, space research, and network topologies.
• Emphasized the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in solving real-life problems.
